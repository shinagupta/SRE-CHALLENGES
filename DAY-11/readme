🚀 Getting Started with Docker: A Step-by-Step Guide
In today’s tech-driven world, Docker is a game-changer for developers and DevOps engineers, simplifying the creation, deployment, and management of applications through containerization. If you’re eager to get started, this guide will walk you through installing Docker and running your first containerized application using NGINX—with diagrams and emojis for a fun learning experience!

🛠️ Step 1: Install Docker/Docker Desktop
To begin, install Docker on your local system or cloud instance. You can download Docker Desktop from the official website or use package managers for your operating system.

Once installed, verify the installation by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker --version
You should see the version number, confirming Docker is ready to go! ✅

🐳 Step 2: Pull and Run a Container
Docker Hub provides a variety of pre-built images. Let’s start by pulling the official NGINX image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker pull nginx
Next, run the container in detached mode with port mapping:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name my-nginx -p 8080:80 nginx
This does the following:

-d: Runs the container in detached mode.
--name: Assigns a name to the container.
-p 8080:80: Maps port 8080 on your host to port 80 on the container.
🌐 You can now access the NGINX welcome page by visiting:
http://localhost:8080

🔍 Step 3: Inspect and Explore
Once your container is up and running, explore its details using these commands:

List all running containers:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker ps
Access the container's logs:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs my-nginx
Inspect the container metadata:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker inspect my-nginx
These commands help you monitor and manage your containers efficiently.

🧑‍🍳 Step 4: Build a Custom Docker Image
Ready to personalize your NGINX container? Let’s create a custom Docker image with your own web page!

📂 1. Prepare Your Project Directory
Download or create an index.html file with your custom content.
Place it in your project directory.
📄 2. Create a Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile in the same directory with the following content:

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM nginx:latest
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
EXPOSE 80
What’s happening here:

🛠️ FROM nginx:latest: Using the latest NGINX image as the base.
📁 COPY: Copies the custom index.html file to NGINX’s document root.
🔓 EXPOSE 80: Exposes port 80 for web traffic.
🔨 3. Build and Tag the Custom Image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t my-nginx:custom .
🚀 4. Run the Custom Container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name my-custom-nginx -p 8081:80 my-nginx:custom
🌐 Step 5: Access and Test
Open your browser and visit:

🌍 Default NGINX: http://localhost:8080
🌍 Custom NGINX: http://localhost:8081
You should see the default NGINX welcome page on port 8080 and your custom webpage on port 8081! 🎉

🖼️ Visualizing the Setup
Here’s a simple diagram to help you visualize the environment:

perl
Copy
Edit
           +---------------------+                  +---------------------+
           |                     |                  |                     |
           |   Docker Container   |                  |   Docker Container   |
           |     my-nginx         |                  |  my-custom-nginx     |
           |   (Port 8080:80)     |                  |   (Port 8081:80)     |
           |        NGINX         |                  |      Custom NGINX    |
           +---------------------+                  +---------------------+
                     |                                         |
                     |                                         |
                     v                                         v
               http://localhost:8080                    http://localhost:8081
The first container serves the default NGINX welcome page.
The second container serves your custom HTML page.
